There are a lot of articles written about search engine optimization (SEO) and
various techniques that can be used to boost the results. The most basic way of
improving the rankings is to make sure that content can be understood correctly
by crawlers.

There's a joint effort among the top search engines to create a common format
for describing the semantic web: [schema.org](http://schema.org).

### How does it work?
By taking advantage of the microdata feature of HTML5, it's possible to
associate metadata about the content that's present on the page. This allows
content editors to specify the type of content, license, creation
date, images and a lot of other attributes by associating a few key properties
with the corresponding HTML tags.

The most important schema.org attributes are:

 * `itemscope` - defines the scope of the other two properties, whether they apply
   to the current entity or to a new one
 * `itemtype` - the entity type (as a namespace URL) 
 * `itemprop` - the name of the property

For more details, be sure to check the [official schema.org documentation](https://schema.org/docs/gs.html#microdata_embedded).

### How can we use it with Jekyll?
It turns out that the schema.org attributes can be integrated very easily with
Jekyll.

#### Individual posts
Let's start with the individual posts. If you're using the default Jekyll setup,
the layout of the posts is most likely defined in the `_layouts/post.html` file.

We need to include the `itemscope`, `itemtype` and `itemprop` attributes as
follows:

``` html
{% raw %}
<div class="post" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

  <header class="post-header">
    <h1 class="post-title" itemprop="name">{{ page.title }}</h1>
    <p class="post-meta">
      <time itemprop="datePublished" datetime="{{ page.date | date_to_xmlschema }}">{{ page.date | date: "%b %-d, %Y" }}</time>
    </p>
  </header>

  <article class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
    {{ content }}
  </article>

  {% include comments.html %}
</div>
{% endraw %}
```

> Note: Be sure to consult the [full list of attributes for the BlogPosting type](https://schema.org/BlogPosting)

#### Index or archive page
Most blogs usually have an index or archive page, which can be further enhanced
about each individual post. The following example describes the process for the
index page, but it can be applied in a similar way to any page that includes
links to blog posts.

``` html
{% raw %}
  <ul class="post-list" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Blog">
    {% for post in site.posts %}
      <li itemprop="blogPost" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">
        <span class="post-meta"><time itemprop="datePublished" datetime="{{ post.date | date_to_xmlschema }}">{{ post.date | date: "%b %-d, %Y" }}</time></span>
        <h2>
                <a class="post-link" href="{{ post.url | prepend: site.baseurl }}" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">{{ post.title }}</span></a>
        </h2>
        
        <div itemprop="description">{{ post.excerpt }}</div>
     </li>
    {% endfor %}
  </ul> 
{% endraw %}
```

#### Test the microformat attributes
Google has provided a testing tool that covers both the basic SEO principles,
but also the structured data that follows the schema.org specifications:
[Structured Data Tool](https://developers.google.com/structured-data/testing-tool/).
